<p>Players.csv</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This is a csv file of all the NBA players that have played in the NBA. In this file the data I am going to use is the player names, their height and weight, born and the college they went too. The database I will need will use this data will be a database named Players, with the columns of player_name, height, weight, born and college. I plan to use this data so you can easily look up which college players have gone to, as well as be able to see who were the tallest/shortest and heaviest/lightest players in the NBA.

<p>Season_stats.csv</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This is a csv file of all the NBA players stats for every season from 1950-2017. I am going to use the year, player (player_name), age, tm (team), g (games played), gs (games started), PER (average_minutes), FG% (field_goal_percentage), 3P% (three_point_percentage), FT% (free_throw_percentage), PTS% (average_points), TRB% (average_rebounds), AST% (average_assists), STL% (average_steals), BLK% (average_blocks), TOV% (average_turnover) and PF% (average_personal_foul) The database I will use this data will be a database name Season Stats, with the columns of player_name, age, team, games_played, games_started, average_minutes, field_goal_percentage, three_point_percentage, free_throw_percentage, average_points, average_rebounds, average_assists, average_steals, average_blocks, average_turnover, and average_personal_foul. I plan to use this data so you are able to see who was the season leader of each year of each stat very easily. For example youâ€™d be able to see who scored the most points in the 1998 season.
